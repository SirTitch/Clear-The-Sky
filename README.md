# Clear-The-Sky
A game created using OpenGL and C++

# About

This game was what I developed for my 4th Year Honours Project at the University of Dundee.
It was created using C/C++ and OpenGL. I used libraries such as GLFW for windowing and AntTweakBar
for my GUI.

The gameplay was inspired by text adventures and a graphic adventure games. It is supposed to be a hybrid
of the two.

To learn more about the development of this please have a read through the paper I wrote documenting and evaluting
the process. ClearTheSkyReport.pdf
